# FlowerPower
Flower Power is personal side project I am working on to develop an 8-bit style idle mobile game, in which the player can build up their garden by earning pollen from planted flowers, and earning experience by playing match-three games to level up and unlock new items for their garden.

Currently the match-three feature and shop mechanic has been developed, and a save system is currently being implemented so the user's garden can be saved.

All assets and sprites being used are currently placeholders I have sourced until I am able to find/create more coherent assets!
